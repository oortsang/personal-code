# Science Olympiad Tests
These are the tests I've written or co-written, mostly for UChicago's yearly invitationals and for local regional and state competitions. Some of the answer keys may not be updated to reflect errors caught at events.

Collaborators not credited on the tests include:
- Katya Gozman, for the Astronomy test for the CPS regional in 2017 and the Astronomy test for UChicago in 2018
- Vijay Srinivasan, for Optics 2018
- David Goldfinger, for the Astronomy test in 2018
