Some of my projects!

NHSGA Games - from CMU's National High School Game Academy summer program, 2015.

There are two games, both made in Unity (in groups of 5). I have included just the executables in the interest of space:
1. Space Cowboy - remake of Atari's classic game Centipede.
2. Kitchen Kravings - designed for Oculus Rift; hungry chef tries to eat as much food as possible without being caught by an angry boss.

Science Olympiad Codebusters, 2018-2019.

I wrote a python script that does the encryption/decryption for most of the ciphers used in the Codebusters event (supports Caesar, Affine, Atbash, generic monoalphabetic (Aristocrats), Vigenere, and Hill Cipher).
Makes test writing and practicing much quicker, easier, and more accurate.
