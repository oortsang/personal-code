Some of my projects!

NHSGA Games - from CMU's National High School Game Academy summer program, 2015.
There are two games, both made in Unity. I have included just the executables in the intereset of space:
1. Space Cowboy - remake of Atari's classic game Centipede.
2. Kitchen Kravings - designed for Oculus Rift; hungry chef tries to eat as much food as possible without being caught by an angry boss.

Science Olympiad Codebusters, 2018-2019.

I wrote a python script that does the encryption/decryption for most of the ciphers used in the Codebusters event.
Makes test writing and practicing much quicker and easier.
